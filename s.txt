I'm working on an admin panel project using:

    Next.js (App Router)

    TypeScript

    Tailwind CSS

    React-Admin

    Dummy data only (no real API yet)

Please help me complete, clean, and upgrade the project with the following requirements:
✅ TECHNICAL TASKS:

    Upgrade the project to Next.js version 15.3.1

    Upgrade all project dependencies (React, Tailwind, React-Admin, etc.) to their latest stable versions

    Remove the Dashboard page entirely (I don't need it)

    Improve layout responsiveness across all screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop)

    Use dummy data for all resources (stored in static files or in-memory arrays)

    Ensure all features/pages are complete and working (no unfinished code or placeholders)

✅ FEATURES TO ADD:

    Add a Dark Mode toggle

        Must work well with Tailwind CSS

        Can store preference in localStorage or use Tailwind's dark class strategy

    Add Authentication:

        Simple Login Page (no backend – just simulate login with dummy user)

        Logout Button with good UX

        Change Password Page (form only, no real backend)

    Improve overall design:

        Clean spacing, padding, layout consistency

        Good typography and structure

        Better sidebar / layout for admin structure

        Use modern UI patterns and Tailwind best practices

✅ PROJECT CONTEXT:

The admin panel manages these resources:

    Hotels

    Yachts

    Tours

    Articles

    Reviews

    Inquiries

    Packages

    FAQs

    News

    Emails

    Settings

Each resource should have full CRUD support using React-Admin with dummy data only.
